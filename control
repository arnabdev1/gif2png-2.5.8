Package: gif2png

Description: convert GIFs to PNGs
 The gif2png program converts files from the Graphic Interchange Format
 (GIF) to Portable Network Graphics (PNG).  This distribution also
 supplies web2png, a Python front end for gif2png which automagically
 converts entire web hierarchies (the graphics files themselves and
 references to them in web pages).
