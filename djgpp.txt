Special notes for gif2png compiled with djgpp (DOS/386)

For MSDOS and similar systems, there are two versions of gif2png available.

gif2png.exe is compiled as a `normal' DOS executable without support for XMS
or EMS or anything and should be used if either you are using a 286 or the
386 version is not working correctly.

gif2png3.exe is compiled as go32 (386 protected mode) executable and works only
on machines with at least a 386sx. This version supports virtual memory
management provided by djgpp. For best performance, you should set the
enviroment variable GO32TMP to a local hard disk, e.g. GO32TMP=c:\tmp.

The program can run under either VCPI or DPMI memory management, if you have
both, you can disable DPMI by adding nodpmi to the GO32 variable (don't ask
me why, I think this a performance plus).

If you are running Windows and the program crashes the system, you might try
to disable screen saver programs, I had problems when After Dark was running.


If you are interested in djgpp and especially in the sources for go32.exe, you
can get the package from some SimTel mirrors in the directory vendors/djgpp,
e.g. on ftp://oak.oakland.edu/SimTel


OK, and if it is not working at all, you can always install Linux and compile
the program yourself, then you shouldn't have problems with memory management
:-)
